"timeBodyAcc-mean()-X_1"  

    Body means it is giving this variable's value for the body
    
    X indicates the axis the measurement is taken along. This applies to Z and Y as well.
    
    Acc means acceleration in standard g units every time this is used. This means a 1 means 1 g (earth gravity) of acceleration.
    
    Mean indicates that this is the average of the variable for each trial, and this appleies to all further variables with mean() in the name
